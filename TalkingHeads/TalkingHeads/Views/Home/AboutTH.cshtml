<p>Talking Heads played their first show in 1975 as a three piece act consisting of David Byrne, Chris Frantz, and Tina Weymouth.  They were active through the mid-70's New York City punk scene eventually recruiting multi-instrumentalist Jerry Harrison (formerly of The Modern Lovers) to fill out their band.</p>
<p>Each studio album from Talking Heads shows the band exploring new genres or types of music that were not traditionally heard in American pop or rock music.  Their first two albums - "Talking Heads: '77" and "More Songs About Buildings and Food" - established their art rock sound and introduced the anxious vocals of David Byrne.</p>
<p>Talking Heads creative peak came by working with Brian Eno as their producer and in his second album with the band they released "Fear Of Music" in 1979 to tremendous critical acclaim.  "Fear of Music" explored darker themes than their previous albums and mixed unconventional song structure with increasingly experimental vocals.  The first song on the album - "I Zimbra" - pulled influence from west African rhythms and would stand as a starting off point for many songs on their next album.</p>
<p>"Remain In Light" was released in 1980 and showed the band expanding even more from their four piece lineup.  Featuring "King Crimson" founder Peter Fripp, guitarist Adrain Belew (known for his work with David Bowie and Frank Zappa), along with an ensamble of musicians the album captures the groundbreaking fusion of genres that Talking Heads captured.</p>
<p>Additional musicians were brought in to tour with in order to try and recreate the complex and layered songs on their newer albums.  Parliament Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell and backup vocalist Dollette McDonald were commonly associated with the band during these years along with a very famous tour featuring Adrian Belew captured in the bootleg "Talking Heads Live In Rome."</p>
<p>"Speaking In Tongues" was released as a followup to "Remain In Light" with a greater focus on keyboard and synthesizer sounds.  The album helped break down barriers between what was seen as "black music" and "white music" at the time. Because of this, many songs were hard to place in a specific genre, such as "Burning Down The House" and "Slippery People."  Talking Heads had been classified as everything from punk rock to art rock, but the ambiguous name of New Wave was given to match this equally ambiguous music.</p>
<p>Talking Head's most famous work was a concert film titled "Stop Making Sense" and directed by Jonathan Demme who would go on to direct "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia."  "Stop Making Sense" was filmed over multiple nights in Los Angeles at the end of the "Speaking In Tongues" tour and edited together in a way to remove most visible cameras and give as close to a 'true concert experience' as could be provided via film.  "Stop Making Sense" has held up over nearly 40 years as the greatest rock concert documentary ever produced and shows Talking Heads in one of their last live shows ever.</p>
<p>Three more albums were released over the rest of the 1980s, but Talking Heads would fail to maintain the same level of critical success despite having more mainstream success than their earlier work.  David Byrne began working on making movies and exploring work as a solo artist and is seen as the driving force as to why Talking Heads never performed live again during this time.  Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth continuued with their side project "The Tom Tom Club" and Jerry Harrison released solo albums before becoming a successful producer for many prominent bands.  Talking Heads went on hiatus in 1987 and in December of 1991 announced they had officially disbanded.  Talking Heads (joined by keyboardist Bernie Worrell and percussionist Steve Scales) performed one last time in March 2002 at their induction ceremony into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.</p>
